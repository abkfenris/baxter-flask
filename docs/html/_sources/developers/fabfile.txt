fabfile.py
==========

`Fabric <http://www.fabfile.org>`_ is basically a makefile, except has server
management built in. Being able to run ``fab prod deploy`` to send your latest
modification to the server is sweet.



Hosts
_____

Fabric seems to work best when you can login into a host with ssh keys, and
have sudo rights. So that the ``fabfile.py`` can be in source control, but
host information can be left out, the fabfile can get hosts from ``fabhosts.py``.

To create ``fabhost.py`` either copy and modify ``fabhost-example.py`` or write
along these lines:

.. code-block:: python

    from fabric.api import env


    def prod():
        env.user = 'user'
        env.hosts = [
            'host.com',
        ]
