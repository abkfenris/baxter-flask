   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to data.Baxter's documentation!
=======================================

Currently the site is in testing at `baxter.alexkerney.com <http://baxter.alexkerney.com>`_.
The goal for the project is to document avalanches that have occured in Baxter
State Park. 

Most people will be looking to start with the :doc:`public`, while those
contributing will probably be looking at :doc:`user`.

If you are looking to adapt this code for another use, spin it up on another
server, or access the :doc:`developers/api` checkout the :doc:`developers/index`.

Contents:
